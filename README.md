# Programming-Exam-1 - Advanced Object Oriented Programming
This programming exam required us to create an ArrayList of type Integer[], where each value of Integer[] would represent a different combination of numbers. We were 
required to implement this combination method recursively. For example 5 choose 3 would be stored in ArrayList<Integer[]> combination as [0,1,2], [0,1,3], [0,1,4], [0,2,3].....
until all possible combinations had been determined.
The final part required us to initialize a binary 2D array. The 2D array represented buildings and their proximity to one another, 0 being far and 1 being close. We were asked to
implement a method that checked each combination of building choices for potentials where all buildings chosen would be close to one another and return a corresponding boolean value.
